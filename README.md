# Sparse-representation-and-its-application-in-computer-vision.
This contains the code and datasets for expression invariant face recognition and background subtraction in videos.
We have used compressive sensing and other sparse representations to model these problems. The thesis can be given
if asked. Background subtraction code contains the basic implementation of the paper:
